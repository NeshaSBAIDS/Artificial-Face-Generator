# Artificial-Face-Generator
This project focuses on developing an Artificial Face Generator using Python and specifically employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
GANs are a type of deep learning architecture that consists of two neural networks, the generator, and the discriminator, working in tandem to generate highly realistic and novel images of human faces. Through this approach, the project aims to push the boundaries of image generation in artificial intelligence and create lifelike human faces with impressive realism and diversity. The implementation includes data preprocessing, GAN model training, and evaluation methods to ensure the quality and authenticity of the generated faces.
