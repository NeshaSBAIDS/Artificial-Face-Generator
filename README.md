# Artificial Face Generator Using Python

This project focuses on creating an Artificial Face Generator using Python, with a primary emphasis on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of generating realistic human faces from scratch. The model utilizes GANs, a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that consists of two neural networks, the generator, and the discriminator, to produce high-quality and diverse synthetic images.

## Features

- Implementation of a GAN architecture for generating artificial faces
- Data preprocessing techniques for face image datasets
- Training the GAN model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation metrics and techniques for assessing the realism and diversity of generated faces

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/artificial-face-generator.git
   ```
   
2. Run the main script to train the GAN model & Generate artificial faces using the trained model:
   ```
   python face_generator.py
   ```
